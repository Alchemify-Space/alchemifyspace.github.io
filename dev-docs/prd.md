That is an excellent idea. Building a website is a crucial step in establishing your brand and offering your services. A well-designed site will serve as the central hub for your business, showcasing your expertise and converting YouTube viewers into clients.

Below are three new graphics specifically designed for your website, followed by a comprehensive Product Requirement Document (PRD) to guide its development.

### **Website Graphics**

Here are three key images to be used on your website, maintaining the consistent "cosmic alchemy" theme.

#### **1. Website Hero Image**

This is the main banner image for your homepage. It's designed to be a grand, welcoming visual that immediately communicates your brand's promise.

#### **2. "Our Services" Section Image**

This graphic visually represents your core service: transforming abstract ideas into concrete digital products like mobile apps, web apps, and cloud solutions.

#### **3. "Portfolio" Section Image**

This image is designed to showcase your past work or project examples. The "scrying pool" concept perfectly fits the theme, presenting a magical view of the digital products you've created.
